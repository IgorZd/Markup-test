          <h2>Issue 01. Theme of the issue</h2>
          <p>
            The first issue of GJ explores the phenomenon of the new museum. The
            contributors to the issue see the new museum as a means to organise
            cultural production in the twenty first century wherein visitors are
            conceived of as co-contributors to the making of culture, its
            preservation and display. By placing emphasis on horizontal
            connections, the new museum emerges as a hub for cultural, social
            and intellectual activity. The first issue of GJ explores the

              communists saw it as an ally of fascism, and the Western
              democracies saw it as a symbol of personal freedom and artistic
              realism—as an ally of both fascism and communism. This
              constellation defined postwar cultural rhetoric. Western art
              critique saw Soviet art as a version of fascist art, and Soviet
              critique saw Western modernism as a continuation of fascist art by
              other means. For both sides, the other was a fascist. And the

              of a cultural war. This constellation defined postwar cultural

              A kind of chain has thus emerged, stretching from Tretyakov to
              Benjamin to Steyerl. Perhaps we could say that Steyerl, by
              combining Tretyakov and Benjamin’s ideas in her own way, has
              restored not so much Tretyakov himself as the Tretyakov who made
              such a decisive impact on Benjamin’s famous lecture. Theodor
              Adorno once noted that when Benjamin wrote “The Work of Art in the
              Age of Mechanical Reproduction,” he had wanted to outdo Brecht. If
              this is true, then perhaps the person who helped him outdo Brecht
              was Brecht’s Russian friend Sergei Tretyakov. A kind of chain has
              thus emerged, stretching from Tretyakov to Benjamin to Steyerl.
